# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: The virtual DOM is basically the threshold between the DOM and React.

Researched answer: The virtual DOM is a concept in React where the virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory, not the actual DOM that React maintains.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: In ruby, methods have implicit return. This basically means that they will be automatically returned without having to "call" upon the return keyword.

Researched answer: This implicit return feature in Ruby makes code more concise and readable, as you don't need to use return explicitly unless you want to exit the method or block early or return a specific value.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: Both object oriented, dynamic, and have libraries. JS is front-end and Ruby is back-end, both with different syntax.

Researched answer: Both JavaScript and Ruby share common characteristics like being high-level, dynamically typed, and having active communities. However, they differ in terms of their execution environments, syntax, and concurrency models, which make them suitable for different types of applications and use cases.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer:

Researched answer:
A version manager is a tool used in software development to manage different versions of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, or other software components installed on a computer system. It allows developers to easily switch between different versions of software, ensuring compatibility with different projects and their specific requirements.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: A testing package for Ruby, much like yarn is for JS.

2. Test-driven development:
   Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach in which tests are written before the actual code implementation. Like we used in Yarn, to ensure we have efficient code.

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete
